    {
      "key": 1,
      "point": "Non-receipt of salary due to MPs.",
      "desecription": "The government pays a salary related to the position of the member of parliament to each member of the public, and arranges to provide a pension.  But no member of our party is bound to perform his service to the people without getting salary.  Its ultimate goal is to create a public service that is not maintained by public money."
    },
    {
      "key": 2,
      "point": "Denial of all allowances including fuel allowance, telephone allowance, office allowance, stamp allowance.",
      "desecription": " It is no secret that the members of Parliament and Provincial Councils as well as local government representatives are entitled to various allowances, and all those allowances are given by the tax payers of this country.  Should the people who pay taxes in this country continue to maintain public representatives?  No.  Politics should be an honorable service.  Therefore, our party rejects all allowances, including fuel allowance, telephone allowance, office allowance and stamp allowance, which are entitled to MPs."

      "point": "Non-enjoyment of government quarters and bungalows.",
      "desecription": " All government offices and bungalows for ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers are rejected by the people's representatives elected by our party.  A very small amount is recovered from the salaries of the ministers for those bungalows.  Water bills, electricity bills and all maintenance of the said quarters or bungalow are done by the internal control department of the ministry of the concerned minister.  Since all the money spent on it is public money, our party will reject government quarters and bungalows that are not maintained by public money."

    {
      "key": 5,
      "point": "Not seeking the assistance of elite security personnel for security and if security is necessary, paying the relevant amount to the government.",
      "desecription": "We don't need elite security personnel to go before the public.  There is no need for elite protection if people's aspirations are properly served without corruption.  But only if there is a threat to the life of the elite, the elite will be protected, and the public representatives appointed by our party are bound to pay the relevant amount to the government."

      "desecription": " In an era where there are many stories related to the canteen in Parliament, at a time when the people of the country are going hungry without food, we cannot enjoy Raja Bojun in Parliament Canteen for a very small amount of money.  Therefore, our party is bound not to enjoy even a cup of katha from the canteen of the Parliament with public money."
